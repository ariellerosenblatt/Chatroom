For our creative portion, we did a variety of things. First, we implemented a system so that whenever a user disconnects or switches rooms, it will alert the other user of their actions, so that the user can easily be aware when people leave and come, and when people switch rooms. We also added a timestamp to each message sent so it is easier to keep track of the flow of the conversation. We also added a series of commands that the user could type in to get various responses. For example, typing /help would give the user a message on how to use the website, /users would give you a printout of all the users in the room right in the conversation div, and then /emojis will give you a list of other commands you can type that would get you to send emojis. For example, /happy sends a happy face, /sad sends a sad face, and so on. We thought this would be a fun and creative way to make our chat server more realistic.
